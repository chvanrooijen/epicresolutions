    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to epicresolutions.org, where you can create a list of actionable resolutions that align with societal
        roles you identify with and causes you care about. The list of resolutions is growing, providing a widening path
        to action for anyone looking to make a difference.</p>
    <p>All resolutions are positively phrased and follow the same, simple structure: 'As a/an [role], I [action] to
        [goal].' For example, an entrepreneur might see, 'As an entrepreneur, I actively promote sustainable practices
        to
        restore nature and foster biodiversity.'</p>
    <p>It's the first letters of the roles they are associated with what makes the resolutions EPIC: Employee, Employer,
        Entrepreneur, Parent or guardian, Politician, Investor, Citizen, Consumer, and Child. Each role offers a unique
        perspective and set of responsibilities, and when combined, they provide a comprehensive view of societal
        engagement.</p>
    <p>To help you follow through on your commitments, the resolutions are associated with causes. Whether it's
        sustainability, equality and diversity, or health and well-being, select the causes that resonate with you to
        prioritize and narrow down down your list.</p>
    <p>You have the freedom to include or exclude resolutions as you like, and once you've completed your list, you can
        save or print it as a daily reminder.</p>
    <p>Interested in contributing code, content, or feedback? Feel free to reach out: <span
            class="email">collaborate@epicresolutions.org</span>.</p>
    <p>The future is going to be EPIC.</p>
